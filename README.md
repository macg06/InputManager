-Are you too familiar with Unity's old Input Manager? Are you worried about them removing it soon?

-A tool for bringing back the old function namings of the InputManager that unity had, fully based on the new Input System! Just as easy and as familiar as before!

-By default, this has a namespace to make sure there's no script conflicts with the same names, but if you want, you can remove the namespace! That way, you won't have to have 2 using namespaces (MACG.InputManager and UnityEngine.InputSystem).
Although, if you use a modern code editor (like Visual Studio 2022), you won't have to bother much with using namespaces. It manually adds them usually.
