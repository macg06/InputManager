-Are you too familiar with Unity's old Input Manager? Are you worried about them removing it soon?

-A tool for bringing back the old function namings of the InputManager that unity had, fully based on the new Input System! Just as easy and as familiar as before!

-Unfortunately, I don't think it's possible to bring back axis reading. I'm sorry! :(
